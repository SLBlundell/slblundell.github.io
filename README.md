## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a final year Economics undergrad at the University of Bristol. I'm incredibly interested in data analysis, specifically how this can relate to microeconomic policy and behavioural economics.

I have worked as a Research Intern for a Chinese foreign policy research project with the university, having written reports to inform policy decisions in Parliment. I also participated in a Spring Internship within HSBC's Global Banking and Markets divisions in London.

I joined a year exchange programme at the Chinese University of Hong Kong during the third year of my degree, taking classes in everything from Chinese financial history and Mandarin to programming and law.

I am proficient in Python, specialising in data analysis and machine learning. I also have experience working in Stata, in addition to HTML and CSS. [You can view a portfolio of Economic data analysis conducted during my degree here](https://slblundell.github.io/).

Finally, I have recently developed a *slight* obsession with basketball, and the intersection of the sport with data. I produced a large project as part of my degree on the role of salary in the NBA, [which can be found here](https://slblundell.github.io/project.html).
